# Multi Tab
Creates a button in the WordPress admin that allows you to open multiple (check-marked) posts / pages / products(WooCommerce) at once.

The plugin is lightweight, it loads only in the WordPress Dashboard having almost no impact in the Dashboard / Server and no impact in the FrontEnd.

**Installation:**

1. Download  the plugin

2. Upload it to your site (if you've installed it through Wordpress Dashboard skip this step)

3. Activate

4. Enjoy!

**Warning**! This plugin relies on JavaScript to work, in some cases it may cause your browser to freeze or the server to work slowly. I recommend using the default listing number (20), if you haven't changed this setting, then ignore and enjoy!
