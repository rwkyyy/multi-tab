== Description ==

Creates a button in the WordPress admin that allows rightfull operators to open multiple (check-marked) posts / pages / products (WooCommerce) at once.
The plugin is lightweight, it loads only in the WordPress Dashboard having almost no impact in the Dashboard / Server and 0 (zero) impact in the Front.

Warning! This plugin relies on JavaScript to work, in some cases it may cause your browser to freeze or the server to work slowly. I recommend using the default listing number (20), if you haven't changed this setting, then ignore and enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Plugin opens just one tab! =
This is normal browser behavior, check for the browser popup blocker to allow your domain, after that try again and it should work as expected.
= Can you make it work with more CPTs? =
To be honest, I did not found the motivation in putting the work for making the plugin compatible with any CPT, but if I see interest in this plugin I'll do that in time, or if you want to submit the update/any other updates yourself, just make a pull on Github.
